== Description ==

I’m a huge fan of Underscores, Bootstrap, and Sass. Why not combine these into a solid WordPress Theme Framework?
That’s what Understrap is.
You can use it as starter theme and build your own theme on top of it. Or you use it as parent theme and create your own child theme for Understrap.

Website: [https://understrap.com](https://understrap.com)

Child Theme Project: [https://github.com/understrap/understrap-child](https://github.com/understrap/understrap-child)

The _s theme is a good starting point to develop a WordPress theme. But it is “just” a raw starter theme. That means it outputs all the WordPress stuff correctly but without any layout or design.
Why not add a well known and supported layout framework to have a solid, clean and responsive foundation? That’s where Bootstrap comes in.

* Combines Underscore’s PHP/JS files and Bootstrap’s HTML/CSS/JS.
* Comes with Bootstrap (v4) Sass source files and additional .scss files. Nicely sorted and ready to add your own variables and customize the Bootstrap variables.
* Uses a single and minified CSS file for all the basic stuff.
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) integration (v4.6.3)
* Comes with extra slider script by [Owl Carousel](http://www.owlcarousel.owlgraphic.com/) (v2.1.4)
* Jetpack ready.
* WooCommerce support.
* [Child Theme](https://github.com/holger1411/understrap-child) ready.
* Translation ready.

== Installation ==

* Download the understrap folder from GitHub or from understrap.com
* IMPORTANT: If you download it from GitHub make sure you rename the "understrap-master.zip" file just to "understrap.zip" or you might have problems using child themes !!
* Upload it into your WordPress installation subfolder here: `/wp-content/themes/`
* Login to your WordPress backend
* Go to Appearance → Themes
